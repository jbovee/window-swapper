# window-swapper
A Chrome extension for swapping the location of two open windows.

## About
Window Swapper adds the functionality of quickly swapping the location of two open Google Chrome windows. Can currently be triggered with a keyboard shortcut (default **should** be set to Alt+s) when only two windows are open, or by clicking the icon and selecting which window to swap the current with.

# Future Ideas
- Selecting a specific window to swap with
  - By number
  - By direction
  - ~~By layout with buttons?~~
- Shifting layout of all windows, similar to ctrl+o with tmux
- Notifications/alerts for when attempted actions don't work
- ~~Popup window from extension icon with buttons for swapping~~
- Keyboard shortcut(s)
  - ~~Base shortcut for only two open windows~~
  - By number 0-9 (some sort of popup to show available windows to swap with and their number)
  - Using arrows keys
- Saving and loading layouts
  - Saving opened tabs as well?
