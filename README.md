# window-swapper
A Chrome extension for swapping the location of two open windows. At the moment only works correctly with two total windows open.

## Future plans
- Selecting a specific window to swap with
  - By number
  - By direction
- Shifting layout of all windows, similar to ctrl+o with tmux
- Notifications/alerts for when attempted actions don't work
- Popup window from extension icon with buttons for swapping
- Keyboard shortcut(s)
